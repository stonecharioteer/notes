# How Linux works

Timeline: 2020-10-25 till date.

## Objective

I have been using Linux since 2007, but I have not dived into
the depths of the topic. I would like in-depth Linux Kernel
knowledge, so that I can both appreciate the system better
and be a more powerful developer.

However, I would like objectifiable goals:

1. Be able to analyse system performance.
2. Be able to compile kernels from source and boot them.
3. Be able to edit the grub bootloader config.
4. Be able to debug a running process using syslogs.

The fact that I do not yet know what I would like to do is
proof that I lack definitive knowledge of the system.

## Chapter 1 The Big Picture

The Linux Kernel provides libraries and interfaces with which
programs can interact with devices. Although, as this book
details later, what the Kernel considers to be devices is
quite interesting.
